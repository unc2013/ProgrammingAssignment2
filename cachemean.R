##
## The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created 
## with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the mean has 
## already been calculated. If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips 
## the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the 
## value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.
##

cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getmean()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- mean(data, ...)
  x$setmean(m)
  m
}
